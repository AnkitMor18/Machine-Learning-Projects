**Project: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

Welcome to the House Price Prediction using Linear Regression project! This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features using my own implementation of linear regression and the algorithm implementation.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we will be using the linear regression algorithm to build a predictive model for house prices. The dataset provided contains information about different houses, such as their size, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant features. We will preprocess the data, train a linear regression model, and evaluate its performance in predicting house prices.

**Languages and Libraries:**

Python

Scikit-learn library

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

**Data Preprocessing**

The data preprocessing steps include:


Loading the dataset.

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical variables.

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Scaling the continuous variables.

**Linear Regression Implementations**

The project includes **two** implementations of linear regression:

**Own Implementation**: My own implementation of linear regression is included in the file. It should contain the code for the necessary functions, such as model training, prediction, and evaluation.

**Algorithm Implementation**: The algorithm implementation of linear regression is provided by the Scikit-learn library. It is used for comparison and benchmarking purposes.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

The model training and evaluation steps include:


Selecting the target variable and features.

Training the linear regression models (own implementation and algorithm implementation) on the training data.

Evaluating the models' performance on the testing data.

Analyzing the evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared score).

**Results and Conclusion**

The project will provide insights into the predictability of house prices based on the available features using both own implementation and the algorithm implementation of linear regression. The evaluation metrics will indicate the performance of the models in predicting house prices accurately. Conclusions can be drawn based on the models' performance and insights gained from the data analysis.
