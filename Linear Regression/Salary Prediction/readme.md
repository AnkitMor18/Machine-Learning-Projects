**Project: Salary Prediction**

Welcome to the Salary Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting salary based on the features of age and experience.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we will be using machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for salary prediction. The dataset provided contains information about individuals' age, experience, and corresponding salaries. We will preprocess the data, train a regression model, and evaluate its performance in predicting salaries based on age and experience.

**Data Preprocessing**

The data preprocessing steps include:

Loading the dataset.

Handling missing values (if any).

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

The model training and evaluation steps include:


Selecting the target variable (salary) and features (age and experience).

Training a regression model (e.g., linear regression) on the training data.

Evaluating the model's performance on the testing data.

Analyzing the evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared score).

**Results and Conclusion**

The project will provide insights into the predictability of salaries based on age and experience. The evaluation metrics will indicate the performance of the trained regression model in predicting salaries accurately. Conclusions can be drawn based on the model's performance and insights gained from the data analysis.
