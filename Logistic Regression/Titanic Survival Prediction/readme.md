**Project: Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression**

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression project! This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using logistic regression.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we will be using logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, to build a predictive model for determining the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset provided contains information about the passengers' features such as age, gender, fare, and cabin class, along with their survival outcomes. We will preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance in predicting passenger survival.

**Languages & Libraries**

Python
Scikit-learn library
Jupyter Notebook

**Data Preprocessing**

The data preprocessing steps include:


Loading the dataset.

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical variables.

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

The model training and evaluation steps include:


Selecting the target variable (survived) and features.

Training a logistic regression model on the training data.

Evaluating the model's performance on the testing data.

Analyzing the evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

**Results and Conclusion**

The project will provide insights into the predictability of passenger survival on the Titanic using logistic regression. The evaluation metrics will indicate the performance of the trained logistic regression model in predicting survival outcomes accurately. Conclusions can be drawn based on the model's performance and insights gained from the data analysis.
