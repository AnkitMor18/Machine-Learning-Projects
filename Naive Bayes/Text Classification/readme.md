**Project: Text Classification using Naive Bayes**

Welcome to the Text Classification project! This project focuses on classifying text documents into different categories using both the Multinomial Naive Bayes implementation in scikit-learn and my own implementation of Naive Bayes from scratch.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we will be using Naive Bayes, a popular machine learning algorithm for text classification tasks. The dataset provided contains a collection of text documents along with their corresponding categories or labels. We will preprocess the text data, train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from scikit-learn, and implement Naive Bayes from scratch for text classification. Finally, we will compare the results of both implementations.

**Languages & Libraries**

Python
Scikit-learn library
Jupyter Notebook

**Data Preprocessing**

The data preprocessing steps include:


Loading the dataset.

Cleaning the text data by removing special characters, numbers, and stopwords.

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

**Multinomial Naive Bayes (sklearn)**

The scikit-learn library provides an implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes that we will use for text classification. We will train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data.

**Naive Bayes Implementation from Scratch**

We will implement Naive Bayes from scratch for text classification in the naive_bayes.py file.Implementation includes the necessary functions, such as model training, prediction, and evaluation.

**Comparing Results**

After implementing Naive Bayes from scratch, we will compare the results of both implementations. We will evaluate the performance of both models using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Results and Conclusion**

The project will provide insights into the performance of Multinomial Naive Bayes implemented in scikit-learn and my own implementation of Naive Bayes from scratch for text classification tasks. The comparison of the results will help in understanding the similarities and differences between the two implementations. Conclusions can be drawn based on the models' performance and insights gained from the data analysis.
